# AC Optimization Project

## Overview
This project simulates and optimizes an air conditioning (AC) system's energy usage and comfort levels over a 24-hour period. It uses Python for data generation, simulation, and analysis, with visualizations in both 2D and 3D formats. The goal is to analyze energy efficiency and recommend adjustments to improve comfort within the 22-24Â°C range.

## Features
- **Simulation**: Generates and adjusts temperature and energy data based on AC settings (Low, Medium, High).
- **Analysis**: Calculates total energy usage, comfort zone occupancy, and setting frequencies.
- **Visualization**: Provides 2D (Energy vs Temperature) and 3D (Time vs Energy vs Temperature) plots.
